        "The new wave rock band Rexy recently found a growing audience in the last couple of years, due in part to Lucky Number and Samantha Urbaniâ€™s discovery of the band. Consequently, three NYU students and 80s music enthusiasts - Mayukh, Utsav and Subigya, chanced upon the music and dedicate a video for the haunting title song, Running Out of Time.",
        "The video illustrates the ideas presented in the song from an existential perspective. Through this, the team attempts to extend the story of the song beyond time and death, to life that was lived/not lived. These ideas are presented through a combination of fluid hand drawn animation and computer generated patterns.",
        "Originally conceived to be presented on the 120ft  x 11ft  IAC Video Wall, the video was created not just as a visual animation for the screen but as a performance that incorporates visuals and the screen projected light to relay the experience in an expansive dark space. The animation combines art and technology. While doing so, it incorporates traditional hand-drawn 2D animation with computer generated 3D patterns.",
        "As artists experimenting with art and technology, they wanted to create an audiovisual experience that is two dimensional technically, but translates to the third dimension using the simple contrast between monochromatic colors. Moreover, the idea was also to lay emphasis on the fact that new media doesn't have to be detached from its traditional roots. Therefore, making hand drawn animations the focal point was necessary. However, it was also necessary to incorporate computer generated visuals seamlessly with the traditional animation."
