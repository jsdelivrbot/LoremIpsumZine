        "\"Peace\" is a global intervention and artistic project in Augmented Reality (AR) about the fake peace deal that took place in Colombia at the end of 2016 and blindly accepted by the international community and supported by the Nobel Prize Organization. As you may not know, President Santos has abused Justice, Democracy, and Human Rights. Corruption is what caused this war. Corruption continues to increase in his administration. He used the money to bribe Colombian people so he can control everything. Corruption makes poverty, misery and inequality, the cause of the war.If he had used the money wisely, the country would have health, education, and housing for the people that most need it. After being terrorized by FARC for 50 years, he gave them impunity, seats in the congress and special areas of the country. The people in Colombia voted against this deal but he did it anyway. This man destroyed our country, we no longer live in a democracy, the economy is falling and the world gave him the Nobel Peace Prize, an insult to Colombians.",
        "I created this AR app that shows him sitting on a throne that represents the power that he has. The statues of Justice disappearing and doves are burning in fire. This video was filmed at Oslo city hall because it is where the Nobel peace prize ceremony took place. If you want to know more about the history of this war please go to this link."
