        "I'm from Texas. I studied Electrical Engineering in my undergraduate program but have always had an interest in art and design. For my graduate studies, I decided to pursue IDM to learn more about incorporating design into my engineering. So far, I enjoyed UX design and VR classes in IDM because it immerses the users in a virtual environment.",
        "Drawn with charcoal from an existing photograph, this self portrait is 24 inches by 30 inches. This drawing was a final project in my Life Drawing course as an undergraduate student. I have never studied art formally prior to this class and attribute all my knowledge and skill to my amazing teacher, Mrs. House. We learned about proportions, foreshortening, and shading. Through this class, I gained a new appreciation for all aspects of art and its critics."
