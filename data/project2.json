        "The project is a collection of audio, short films, and 360 video/VR experiences that are all connected to the same story about virtual dream experiences, conscience, and loss of self. The purpose of this piece is to explore a personal narrative through multiple visual and auditory angles. ",
        "Robert wanted to create an experience based on personal events that happened last year, and he had to get at certain ideas that he couldn’t put into words, and found that the intersection of mediums like VR and experimental film provided a language he could use.",
        "Robert hopes that people will be affected by his experience in some way, and he can’t hope to control what anyone takes from it. Robert does, however, wish that people would take away a story from it and understand something about the narrative that he is trying to tell, even if they won’t be able to put it into words."
