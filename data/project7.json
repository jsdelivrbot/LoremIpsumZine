        "Cassandra is gifted the power of prophecy in Greek mythology. However, as she is cursed, nobody believes her prophecy. In some Asian countries, once a child is born, their parents will take them to a fortune teller or astronomer to predict the child’s whole life, from what job they will choose to when and where they are going to get married. Those predictions are usually on big events. Career, marriage, money. That is all people care about their future lives. What if there is a kind of prophecy, that only predicts trivial things? Even if trivial predictions are to be believed, does that make any difference at all? On the other hand, what if the predictions are so absurd that you can immediately assure that it is not going to happen? Do you still believe in the prophecy?",
        "The culture I grew up with believes in a very different kind of fortune telling from western culture. But in all kinds of culture, there are superstitious people. Prophecies sometimes give hope to those who believes. But to deeply rely on it, is a totally different thing. I’m trying to show the absurdness by making a tool that only predicts trivial or surreal statements."
