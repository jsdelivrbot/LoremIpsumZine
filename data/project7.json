        "This interactive piece is a statement about privacy in today's camera heavy world. It lets users walk up to a TV and see themselves as a shader on different channels, and the purpose was to explore the feeling you get while being watched. It also flips the script in a way that makes you both the viewer and performer. What Davon and Yu Hsuan are trying to convey here is how society is obsessed with cameras and zombie media. They wanted to explore what would happen if they combined two mediums from two different time frames. Hopefully people think twice before sharing data on the internet, privacy is a lot more important than everyone often realizes.",
        "Though Microsoft has discontinued the Kinect, it's still a favorite of a lot of Processing and OpenFrameworks developers and artists. OpenFrameworks is a powerful C++ library that gives you a range of fantastic tools like the ability to use shaders and filters like the ones you see here. Being here at IDM and surrounded by such creative people, they are excited if someone else was inspired to create something with this instruments because of this project."
