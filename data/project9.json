        "Living in the United States has allowed Mateo to understand, in-depth, the social reality of the most developed capitalist country in the world and to get in touch with virtual reality, one of the most important new digital media technologies under development. By understanding that, in the past, most of the technological advances ended up being used for purposes that did not solve the vital needs of society, Mateo became concerned for the future use of Virtual Reality for the same objectives. When analyzing important historical events and thoughts of renowned philosophers, he was able to understand the causes that generated the misuse of technologies. This led him to propose a possible solution based on the creation of an artistic Virtual Reality experience that generate powerful emotions related to a political view about where we are going as a society."
