        "Creative technology helps broaden the idea of fashion and revive the lifeless waste that people would otherwise toss away. Selected as one of the fashion entries for the NYU Shanghai Trash Fashion Show 2017 - this dress debuted on the runways of Himalaya Museum of Art, Shanghai. The dress explores the themes of pollution and industrialization.",
        "The plastic bags are representative of the haze and smog; whereas the wires and straws are rigid structures that define the edifices and highways that have risen and carved their way into the city. While this piece has mainly been put together using recycled materials, it also incorporates LED lights to add an element of futurism to the dress. The flow of gradient through the dress was created using an Arduino."
