        "This project is designed to reveal the immense history behind 227 Abolitionist Place Museum Heritage Center which is located in New York City. New York was the second largest slave-owning state in the nation during the 1800s, but the area of Downtown Brooklyn was once an enclave of abolitionist activity. 227 Abolitionist Place was one of the safe houses along the Underground Railway for African-Americans and escaping slavery. The goal of this project is to allow visitors to learn the history of African American and the Underground Railroad in NYC without too much reading. The creators built an interactive exhibit which can allow people to communicate with the abolitionist through a telephone. Also, visitors can watch the stereoscope to view the historical situation. The exhibit also serves to raise awareness of the roots of slavery in New York."
