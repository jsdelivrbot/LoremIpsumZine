        "Technology has taken away the sense of surprise that any computer revolution has led to. In the past, each device provided just one function: an old handset was used to make phone calls; a vinyl record was used to listen to music; a camera was used to record images on film. Today, all these devices are combined into a single one.",
        "When people use an old device they are usually surprised and nostalgic. This media archeology project uses a Game Boy for taking portraits. Images are black and white and with low-resolution. By taking high-resolution pictures of the device itself, the picture-in-picture shows the progression of technology. People do not realize how many features are possible to add to each shot. The stripes represent the colors associated with the person portrayed when the picture was taken.",
        "This media project has the aim to recall the nostalgia by forcing the observer to combine shapes and colors and to imagine a mixed-media in their mind."
