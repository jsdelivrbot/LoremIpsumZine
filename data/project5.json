        "The piece is a metaphorical imagination of the future as a sort of authoritarian capitalist hell, similar to Philip K Dick/Blade Runner. Inspired by the synthesis of Foucault’s panopticon and Guy Debord’s idea of the Spectacle, the human here is the Subject who is bombarded with surveillance and overwhelming barrage of advertisements selling products and sex. Advertisement itself constitutes a form of self policing mechanism, in effect, serving as a panoptic device of control. Advertisements don’t sell a product, but a fetishized lifestyle. It serves, by selling a lack, to sell this false consciousness. The third person view of the person looking at the artwork is a view without the trappings of false consciousness, as \"They Live\".",
        "The walk cycle of the subject is hand drawn pixel animation and the rest of the background and foreground is programmatically generated using p5.js. The background score that I'm using Dubstepology by Alumo."
